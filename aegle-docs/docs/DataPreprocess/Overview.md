# Introduction

*Last updated: September 2024*

This module handles the essential preprocessing steps for multiplex imaging data (PhenoCycler/CODEX) before downstream analysis. 

It can be executed by modifying and running the main shell script:

```bash
run_preprocess_ft.sh
```

## Processing Pipeline Architecture

![Aegle Preprocessing Pipeline](../../static/img/aegle-preprocess.drawio.png)

## Main Entry Script

The preprocessing workflow is orchestrated by the main entry script:

```bash
run_preprocess_ft.sh [MAX_CONCURRENT]
```

### Key Features

- **Batch Processing**: Processes multiple experiments defined in the `EXPERIMENTS` array
- **Parallel Execution**: Supports concurrent processing with configurable limits (default: 2 concurrent experiments)
- **Automated Workflow**: Sequentially executes tissue extraction followed by antibody extraction for each experiment
- **Comprehensive Logging**: All output and errors are logged to individual files per experiment
- **Process Management**: Monitors and controls background processes with PID tracking

### Script Configuration

The script requires configuration of several key variables:

- **Experiment Set**: Defined by `EXP_SET_NAME` (e.g., "preprocess/preprocess_ft")
- **Experiment IDs**: Listed in the `EXPERIMENTS` array (e.g., "D10", "D11", "D13", etc.)
- **Directory Structure**: 
  - Configuration files: `exps/configs/{EXP_SET_NAME}/{EXP_ID}/config.yaml`
  - Log files: `logs/{EXP_SET_NAME}/{EXP_ID}.log`
  - Output directory: Uses the same data directory as input

### Execution Flow

For each experiment ID, the script:

1. **Tissue Extraction**: Calls `scripts/run_extract_tissue.sh` to identify and extract tissue regions
2. **Antibody Extraction**: Calls `scripts/run_extract_antibody.sh` to extract antibody marker information
3. **Logging**: Captures all output with timestamps for debugging and monitoring

The preprocessing pipeline consists of two sequential steps:

### 1. Tissue Region Extraction

We provide two methods to extract tissue regions: manual and automatic. Currently, we recommend using the manual method for better precision. The automatic method is used to provide preliminary results before manual annotation.

#### Manual Tissue Region Extraction

```bash
preprocess_napari/napari_annotation.py
```

This interactive tool provides a napari-based interface for manual annotation and tissue region extraction from QPTIFF files. Key features include:

- **Interactive Annotation**: Uses napari's polygon tool to manually delineate tissue regions with high precision
- **Batch Processing**: Processes multiple QPTIFF files sequentially with resume capability
- **Auto-Save Functionality**: Automatically saves annotations in JSON format with coordinate data and metadata
- **Thumbnail Generation**: Creates visual overview images showing annotated regions with ROI labels
- **Area Calculation**: Automatically calculates area for each ROI in both pixels and mmÂ² units
- **Quality Control**: Supports viewing and regenerating existing annotations for validation

The tool outputs standardized annotation files (`{filename}_annotations.json`) and visual thumbnails (`{filename}_annotation_overview.png`) that can be used for downstream tissue region extraction and analysis.

More details about the manual annotation tool can be found in its README file in the `preprocess_napari/` directory.

#### Automatic Tissue Region Extraction

```bash
src/extract_tissue_regions.py
```

This script identifies and extracts regions of interest from the raw imaging data using the following techniques:
- Downsampling of the original image (configurable via `downscale_factor`)
- Sobel edge detection and watershed segmentation with Otsu thresholding
- Connected component labeling and filtering by minimum area
- Extraction of the largest tissue regions (configurable via `n_tissue`)

Each detected tissue region is then cropped from the original high-resolution image and saved as a separate OME-TIFF file.

### 2. Antibody Data Extraction

```bash
src/extract_antibodies.py
```

This script processes the QPTIFF metadata to extract antibody/channel information:
- Extracts the OME-XML metadata from the QPTIFF using Bio-Formats' `showinf` tool
- Parses the XML to identify channel IDs and antibody names
- Creates a standardized TSV file mapping channel IDs to antibody names

## Configuration Parameters

The pipeline uses YAML configuration files located at:
```
exps/configs/{EXP_SET_NAME}/{EXP_ID}/config.yaml
```

Key configuration parameters include:
- `data.file_name`: Path to the input QPTIFF file
- `tissue_extraction.n_tissue`: Number of tissue regions to extract (default: 4)
- `tissue_extraction.downscale_factor`: Factor to downsample the image for initial detection (default: 64)
- `tissue_extraction.min_area`: Minimum area for a valid tissue region (default: 500)
- `tissue_extraction.visualize`: Whether to generate visualization of detected regions (default: false)
- `tissue_extraction.skip_roi_crop`: If true, skips ROI detection and saves the full image (default: false)

## Execution Workflow

1. The main script (`run_preprocess_ft.sh`) defines experiment set name, data directories, and experiment IDs
2. For each experiment ID:
   - Calls `run_extract_tissue.sh` to identify and extract tissue regions
   - Then calls `run_extract_antibody.sh` to extract antibody marker information
   - All output and errors are logged to `{LOG_DIR}/{EXP_ID}.log`

## Command Arguments

Both extraction scripts accept similar arguments:
- `--config`: Path to the YAML config file
- `--data_dir`: Directory containing the input data (default: "../data")
- `--out_dir`: Output directory for processed files
